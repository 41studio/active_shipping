# Active Shipping

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Shopify/active_shipping.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Shopify/active_shipping)

This library interfaces with the web services of various shipping carriers. The goal is to abstract the features that are most frequently used into a pleasant and consistent Ruby API. Active Shipping is an extension of [Active Merchant](http://activemerchant.org/), and as such, it borrows heavily from conventions used in the latter.
