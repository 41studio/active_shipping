# Active Shipping

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Shopify/active_shipping.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Shopify/active_shipping)

This library interfaces with the web services of various shipping carriers. The goal is to abstract the features that are most frequently used into a pleasant and consistent Ruby API. Active Shipping is an extension of [Active Merchant][], and as such, it borrows heavily from conventions used in the latter.

Active Shipping is currently being used and improved in a production environment for [Shopify][]. Development is being done by the Shopify integrations team (<integrations-team@shopify.com>). Discussion is welcome in the [Active Merchant Google Group][discuss].
